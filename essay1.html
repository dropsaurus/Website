      <h1>on the power of simplicity</h1>
      <div class="meta">may 2025</div>

      <p>
        i've noticed something peculiar about how we solve problems in the
        technology industry. we have a tendency to add complexity when
        simplicity would serve us better. this pattern repeats itself across
        product development, design, and engineering.
      </p>

      <p>
        i have an excellent prof in mathew campisi who teaches rtes at nyu. in
        the very first class, he mentioned how a defense project he was tasked
        with failed becasue of over-enginerring. you have a problem, your aim to
        is to reach the minimum viable product in the least number of steps
        possible, fail if you have to, but the reduce the steps and deiver,
      </p>

      <p>
        the instinct to add rather than subtract seems to be deeply ingrained in
        how we think. when faced with a problem, our first impulse is often to
        build something new—add a feature, create a process, or introduce a
        tool. rarely do we consider what we might remove to make things better.
      </p>

      <p>
        this additive bias manifests in products bloated with features that few
        use, in codebases riddled with unnecessary abstractions, and in designs
        cluttered with elements that distract rather than clarify. we've been
        conditioned to equate more with better.
      </p>

      <p>
        but the most elegant solutions are often subtractive. consider the
        evolution of the smartphone interface. early mobile operating systems
        attempted to miniaturize the desktop experience, cramming tiny icons and
        complex menus onto small screens. it wasn't until designers embraced the
        constraints of mobile—removing elements rather than adding them—that
        truly usable interfaces emerged.
      </p>

      <p>
        or look at successful consumer products. the ones that achieve mass
        adoption tend to do one thing exceptionally well, rather than many
        things adequately. they remove friction and cognitive load instead of
        adding capabilities.
      </p>

      <p>
        i've found this principle applies equally well to writing code. my best
        technical work has come not from adding clever algorithms or intricate
        patterns, but from removing unnecessary complexity. as programmers, we
        often measure our contributions by lines of code written. perhaps we
        should measure them by lines of code deleted instead.
      </p>

      <p>
        the barrier to embracing simplicity isn't technical—it's psychological.
        it requires overcoming the bias that equates effort with addition. it
        demands the confidence to recognize what's essential and the courage to
        discard what isn't. and perhaps most challenging, it requires resisting
        the temptation to demonstrate our value through visible complexity.
      </p>

      <p>
        in a culture that celebrates building and creating, there's something
        counterintuitive about improvement through removal. yet the most
        profound innovations often come from taking things away: removing
        friction from commerce, eliminating steps from a process, or stripping
        away layers between people and what they want to accomplish.
      </p>

      <p>
        i've begun to apply this lens to my own work, asking not "what can i add
        to make this better?" but "what can i remove?" the results have been
        surprising. projects move faster. users understand products more
        intuitively. code becomes more maintainable.
      </p>

      <p>
        simplicity isn't simple. it requires deliberate effort to achieve and
        constant vigilance to maintain. but the payoff—in clarity, usability,
        and impact—makes it worth pursuing.
